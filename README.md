What Makes SafeDoge Unique?

Big problem in the emerging DeFi industry is the existence of high APY LP-farms that don't have easy access for newcomers to the space.

With SafeDoge, they aim to use the idea of static rewards (making the reward conditional upon the volume of the token being traded) in order to remove any pressure on the token that could occur when tokens are sold. As well, “reflect mechanism“ adds incentive for SafeDoge holders to keep their tokens for longer, or HODL. SafeDoge Automatic LP also adds stability to the protocol by providing a price floor/cushion for token holders. SafeDoge manual burn strategy also helps SafeDoge token holders in the long term.

Managing and using the cash flow from the NFT sale will help SafeDoge's price and liquidity rise. Supporting charitable funds will help unhappy lives and help the project become more popular

How Many Safedoge (SAFEDOGE) Coins Are There in Circulation?

A total supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000 with 500,000,000,000,000 burned dev tokens and a fair launch supply of 500,000,000,000,000

In each trade, the transaction is taxed with a fee of 10%, which is cut in half. While 5% of the fee is redistributed to all of the token holders at the time, the other 5% is then split in half again, with 50% sold by the contract into BNB, and the remaining 50% automatically paired with the aforementioned BNB and added to PancakeSwap as a liquidity pair.
